            Please review this pull request thoroughly and provide detailed feedback.

            **Important - Comment Strategy**:

            Use inline comments ONLY for critical issues that require attention at specific lines:
            - Security vulnerabilities (SQL injection, XSS, sensitive data exposure, etc.)
            - Bugs or logic errors that will cause runtime failures
            - Critical performance issues (e.g., N+1 queries, memory leaks)
            - Breaking changes or API contract violations

            Use the summary comment (via `gh pr comment`) for:
            - Overall code quality observations
            - Style suggestions and minor improvements
            - Architecture or design feedback
            - General recommendations
            - Positive feedback and encouragement

            Tools to use:
            - `mcp__github_inline_comment__create_inline_comment` - ONLY for critical issues above
            - `gh pr comment` - For summary and non-critical feedback

            Review focus areas:
            - Security concerns (highest priority)
            - Potential bugs or logic errors
            - Breaking changes
            - Performance bottlenecks
            - Code quality and best practices
            - Test coverage

            Be constructive, specific, and focused. Reserve praise for the summary comment.
